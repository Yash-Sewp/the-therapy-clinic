              <strong>“The Therapy Clinic”</strong> is an occupational therapy practice which was established in Gauteng in 2000. The focus is on goal directed intervention to ensure optimal functioning of both children and adults. <br /> 
              A strong emphasis is placed on the quality of intervention and thorough approach to implementation. This is done within the framework of insightful assessments, clinical interpretation of findings within the specific context of each individual and specific goal-directed therapy. <br /> For child intervention, regular consultation and liason with the parents/caregivers is engaged in, to ensure carry over of management into the home and school environment and hence maximum progress. <br /> With adults, much support and mentoring is effected to obtain optimal functioning of the individual in daily life. <br /> The therapists have extensive experience in their respective fields of work. <br /> The Occupational Therapist is trained in Sensory Integration and Neurodevelopmental Therapy (NDT). Her work experience spans both public and private hospitals as well as schools for Cerebral Palsy, Cognitively Challenged and Remedial Support (learning difficulties). <br /> The Speech Therapist has her doctorate in Diagnostic Audiology and significant experience in neurodevelopmental therapy, family centred intervention and auditory processing therapy.
