If rendered unable to, then modification of the occupation or the environment is implemented to better support their occupational engagement.

                Your child’s life is made up of occupations, or everyday activities. These occupations include playing,
                learning, sleeping and resting, interacting with friends, getting dressed, and other daily activities.
                Many of us generally don’t think about a child’s daily occupations until he or she has challenges doing
                them. Everyone has occupations—from the toddler whose occupations are playing and learning, to the older
                child whose occupations are being a student and developing the skills to become more independent.

              Trauma counselling is a short-term intervention, which is indicated when a person has suffered a traumatic incident. The therapist provides a grounded presence for the individual to explore their trauma while feeling safe, listened to and held.
            </p>
            <p>
              Counselling is the skilled and principled use of a therapeutic relationship to facilitate self- knowledge, emotional acceptance and growth and the optimal development of personal resources.
